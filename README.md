# Hello-World
This is my first Repository
My name is Kholofelo. I graduated in IT Programming and want to develop a career in IT. My strengths include problem solving, excellent communications skills and the ability to demonstrate leadership in a team environment. I believe my strongest assets are my self- disciplined professional attitude, adaptability, attention to details, eagerness to learn more to develop the highest standards possible. I would like an opportunity that allows me to add value and grow into an organisation by applying my knowledge and passion of IT.
